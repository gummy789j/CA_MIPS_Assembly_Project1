Computer Organization Project 1 – MIPS Assembly 1

Due: 23:55, Mar. 17, 2021
In this start-up project, you are required to get familiar with both MARS (MIPS 
Assembler and Runtime Simulator) programming environment and basic MIPS 
(Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) integer instructions. Please write a program to perform body mass index (BMI) computation. The inputs (weight in kilogram and height in centimeter) and output (BMI) are all integers. Do NOT use any floating point instruction in this project. The formula for BMI computation is listed as follows. BMI = Weight×10000 / Height^2. If the BMI is larger than or equal to 24, print "You are overweight". If the BMI is less than or equal to 18, print "You are underweight".
Please submit your source code according to the following rules:
1- Write down enough comments such that you would receive higher scores.
2- The filename is your student ID (e.g., B12345678.asm).

Example:
Please input your weight in kilogram:
80
Please input your height in centimeter:
170
Your BMI is 27. You are overweight.
Please input your weight in kilogram:
50
Please input your height in centimeter:
165
Your BMI is 18. You are underweight.
Please input your weight in kilogram:
55
Please input your height in centimeter:
160
Your BMI is 21
